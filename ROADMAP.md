  - **Acceptance:** Sessions terminate cleanly at turn limit instead of being killed

- [x] **QW-4** — Fix prompt_analyze score inflation (FINDING-240: scores cluster at 8-9/10 regardless of quality) `P1` `S`
  - File: `internal/enhancer/scoring.go` — lowered baselines (30/25), added trivial-prompt penalties, missing-structure penalties; strict weighted average with no coherence bonus
  - **Acceptance:** Score distribution spans 3-9 range on test corpus — verified via `TestScore_TrivialPromptInflation`, `TestScore_DistributionSpan`, `TestScoringCalibration`, `TestScore_WeakDimensionsDragOverall`

- [x] **QW-5** — Fix prompt_enhance stage skipping transparency (FINDING-243: stages silently skipped) `P1` `S`
  - File: `internal/enhancer/pipeline.go` — add `SkippedStages` field to result, log skip reasons
  - **Acceptance:** Enhanced result includes list of skipped stages with reasons

- [x] **QW-6** — Fix loop_gates zero-baseline bug (FINDING-226/238: baseline zero-init, 2nd cycle recurrence) `P0` `S`
  - File: `internal/session/loop_gates.go` — ensure baseline save errors propagate, initialize from first observation
  - **Acceptance:** `loop_gates` returns meaningful deltas on first run after baseline

  - File: `internal/session/snapshot.go` — update path resolution to use ralphglasses project root
  - **Acceptance:** Snapshots save to `.ralph/snapshots/` not `claudekit/` path

- [x] **QW-8** — Fix budget params silently ignored in session_launch (FINDING-258/261) `P0` `S`
  - File: `internal/mcpserver/tools_session.go` — wire budget_usd and max_turns params through to LaunchOptions
  - **Acceptance:** `session_launch budget_usd=5.0` actually enforces $5 budget

- [x] **QW-9** — Persist autonomy level changes across restarts (FINDING-257) `P1` `S`
  - File: `internal/session/autooptimize.go` — write autonomy level to `.ralph/autonomy.json`

## Whiteclaw Migration Autonomy Notes `[NEW]`

Immediate roadmap notes for improving the perpetual autonomous development cycle while the whiteclaw migration program expands across the fleet.

- [x] **WM-1** — Add a tranche checkpoint emitter that writes docs-side migration updates after each completed wave instead of relying on manual session summaries `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` + roadmap export surface
  - Shipped via `ralphglasses_roadmap_export format=checkpoint` with repo, component, verification, and next-wave sections for docs-side checkpoint stubs
  - **Acceptance:** a completed tranche can emit a docs checkpoint stub with repo, component, verification, and next-wave data

- [ ] **WM-2** — Add GitHub capability probing before publish or repo-creation tasks so loops know the difference between connector install, CLI auth, push rights, and repo-creation rights `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` + `internal/roadmap/`
  - **Acceptance:** planner can block or reroute publish/create tasks when auth or app capability is missing
  - Field note (2026-04-08): root-shell auth looked blocked while the real operator lane (`hg` over SSH) could fetch and push, so capability probes need to test the actual publish identity instead of one ambient shell context

- [ ] **WM-3** — Add a component-level migration ledger input so loops can plan from `source artifact -> target repo -> verification` instead of repo-only backlog slices `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` + docs ingest
  - **Acceptance:** roadmap tooling can ingest a machine-readable whiteclaw component map and rank next tranches from it
  - Field note (2026-04-08): `docs/projects/agent-parity/whiteclaw-component-migration-map.json` is now the first real fixture this ingest path should consume

- [ ] **WM-4** — Add existing-equivalent detection before proposing new repos; only create a new repo when no existing repo can coherently own the migrated surface `P1` `S`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` repo-classification heuristics
  - **Acceptance:** planner records why an existing repo was selected or why no viable owner existed

- [ ] **WM-5** — Prefer clean publish lanes via dedicated worktrees when canonical repos are dirty or ahead/behind, instead of mixing tranche commits into unstable checkouts `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` + operator workflow docs
  - **Acceptance:** publish-oriented loops can select a safe worktree branch strategy automatically
  - Field note (2026-04-08): `surfacekit` and `docs` both required clean publish clones because the operator checkouts were dirty and one checkout was also ahead/behind `origin/main`

- [ ] **WM-6** — Keep a rolling next-tranche queue and auto-promote the next wave immediately after the prior wave verifies cleanly `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` + session loop selection
  - **Acceptance:** completing one tranche updates the ranked next-tranche backlog without manual reseeding
  - Field note (2026-04-08): the live queue advanced from docs-side ledger work to `surfacekit` contradiction evidence and then to `.github` reusable workflow rollout without re-running a fresh fleet scan

---

## Autonomous Tranche Delivery Notes [NEW]

Immediate roadmap notes captured from the Jellyfin ecosystem rollout so the perpetual autonomous build loop can patch its own delivery workflow instead of repeating operator-side mistakes.

- [ ] **ATD-1** — Add a publish-lane planner that selects `dirty checkout -> clean worktree -> detached mainline push` automatically when the canonical repo has unrelated edits `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` + `internal/roadmap/`
  - **Acceptance:** publish tasks can choose a safe worktree strategy without manual operator intervention

- [ ] **ATD-2** — Add a durable auth bootstrap probe that verifies `gh` keyring login, SSH key presence, `gh auth setup-git`, and org push rights before any repo push or repo-create task `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` + `internal/roadmap/`
  - **Acceptance:** planner can distinguish "not logged in", "SSH not registered", "org visible but push denied", and "fully publishable"

- [ ] **ATD-3** — Add host-override checkpoint capture so loops persist runtime discoveries like occupied ports, image-source fallbacks, and remote mount findings into reusable docs and machine-readable patch artifacts `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` + docs export + autobuild patch feed
  - **Acceptance:** a completed tranche emits both human docs updates and a machine-readable host-override record

- [ ] **ATD-4** — Add wrapper-first rollout heuristics so loops prefer building bootstrap, preflight, health, backup, restore, and unit-install surfaces before expanding service count `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` planning heuristics
  - **Acceptance:** multi-service deployment plans rank operational control-plane work ahead of lower-leverage optional integrations

- [ ] **ATD-5** — Add tranche receipt emission after every successful push, recording repo, commit SHA, verification commands, blockers cleared, and ranked next actions `P1` `S`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` + docs checkpoint integration
  - **Acceptance:** each tranche can leave a compact machine-ingestable receipt for the next autonomous loop

- [ ] **ATD-6** — Add automatic docs-sync suggestions when implementation changes introduce new operator-facing commands, ports, env vars, or recovery flows `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` + repo diff analysis
  - **Acceptance:** loops flag doc debt before publish when command surfaces or runbooks have drifted

- [ ] **ATD-7** — Add environment-secret boundary detection so loops keep implementing non-secret tranches while correctly deferring only the secret-gated surfaces such as VPN credentials or service API keys `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` planning + blockers model
  - **Acceptance:** a missing secret blocks only the dependent tranche instead of freezing the full roadmap

- [x] **ATD-8** — Prioritize remote-main-reproduced commit-gate failures ahead of broader roadmap breadth so autobuild can restore a green publish lane before taking more feature work `P0` `S`
  - Target: `internal/repofiles/` + `internal/session/` + autobuild tranche selection notes
  - Shipped by repairing scaffold/test contract drift and aligning stale Gemini write expectations to the native `.gemini/agents/*.md` surface on top of current `main`
  - **Acceptance:** source-backed red commit-gate regressions are fixed and recorded before the next breadth tranche begins

- [ ] **ATD-9** — Add alternate-env validation heuristics so every new operational script is tested against a temp env file and non-default data roots before publish `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` tranche verification + autobuild patch feed
  - **Acceptance:** rollout tranches that add backup, restore, maintenance, or other host-touching scripts emit proof that `--env-file` and relocated roots behave correctly in isolation

- [ ] **ATD-10** — Add artifact-integrity gates before any retention pruning or restore recommendation `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` execution + tranche receipt model
  - **Acceptance:** loops verify generated archives or equivalent recovery artifacts before pruning older generations or documenting restore readiness

- [x] **ATD-11** — Add a tracked-temp-artifact gate to repo verification so stray temp outputs and placeholder files fail fast before longer commit checks run `P0` `S`
  - Target: `scripts/dev/` + autobuild patch queue memory
  - Shipped via `scripts/dev/check-tracked-artifacts.sh`, `scripts/dev/test_tracked_artifacts.sh`, and commit-gate wiring in `scripts/dev/ci.sh` and `scripts/dev/pre-commit`
  - **Acceptance:** repo-owned verification names offending tracked artifact paths and fails deterministically before deeper CI stages continue

- [x] **ATD-12** — Repair generated provider-role projection drift immediately once the gate reproduces it on current `main` so the publish lane returns to green before the queue advances `P0` `S`
  - Target: `.claude/agents/` + `.gemini/agents/` + autobuild tranche sequencing
  - Shipped by regenerating provider role projections from `.agents/roles/*.json` after `scripts/sync-provider-roles.py --check` failed on current `main`
  - **Acceptance:** `python3 scripts/sync-provider-roles.py --check` and full `scripts/dev/ci.sh` pass on current `main` after the resync
- [ ] **ATD-13** — Add overlay-risk detection for automations that can hide local state, such as remote mounts or generated mirror directories `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` safety heuristics + operator prompt generation
  - **Acceptance:** plans default to explicit opt-in flags or guard rails whenever an automation would shadow non-empty local paths

## Perpetual Development Cycle Notes `[NEW]`

Operator continuity notes captured from the Hyprland persistence rollout. These are future autopatch and autobuild follow-ups so desktop iteration can keep terminal state alive while still landing verified tranche commits continuously.

- [ ] **PDC-1** — Add a desktop destructive-action classifier so planner loops distinguish `safe_reload` from `explicit_restart` when Hyprland, launchers, or other session-bearing UI surfaces are involved `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` planner prompts + `internal/roadmap/` task annotations
  - **Acceptance:** desktop tasks touching reload/restart flows default to safe reload lanes unless a hard restart is explicitly requested

- [ ] **PDC-2** — Add tmux continuity preflight checks to roadmap and autobuild execution: main session presence, TPM bootstrap, resurrect/continuum availability, and last persistence-health result `P0` `S`
  - Target: `internal/session/` + `internal/roadmap/`
  - **Acceptance:** loops fail fast on "persistence configured but not operational" before they schedule risky reload or restart work

- [ ] **PDC-3** — Emit verified tranche checkpoints after each commit with tests run, files touched, publish outcome, and next-tranche seed so long-running loops can resume without reconstructing session context `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` + checkpoint/journal surfaces
  - **Acceptance:** every completed tranche can produce a resumable machine-readable checkpoint entry

- [ ] **PDC-4** — Probe publish-lane capabilities before promising "push between tranches": SSH auth, connector write access, branch protection, divergence from `main`, and dirty-worktree risk `P0` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` publish orchestration
  - **Acceptance:** planner reports whether publish can happen via SSH, GitHub app, clean worktree, or is blocked before tranche work begins
  - Field note (2026-04-08): publish preflight also needs to classify which local identity has auth and whether the current checkout is a safe commit lane or just a source of files for a clean clone

- [ ] **PDC-5** — Prefer clean worktree publish lanes for tranche commits when live repos are dirty, then mirror the landed tranche diff back into the operator checkout without overwriting unrelated edits `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/session/` + operator workflow docs
  - **Acceptance:** autonomous publish flows stop depending on committing from dirty working trees
  - Field note (2026-04-08): the same fallback should cover bare-repo operator layouts like `ralphglasses`, where a normal clean clone is simpler than trying to publish from the live checkout

- [ ] **PDC-6** — Add desktop continuity regression fixtures to autobuild smoke suites: safe reload must not restart Hyprshell, dropdown terminals must not kill tmux sessions, and tmux persistence health must pass before restart lanes execute `P1` `M`
  - Target: `internal/roadmap/` + future autobuild smoke harness
  - **Acceptance:** future autonomous desktop patches catch session-destroying regressions before merge

- [x] 3.5.4.5 — Add Codex plugin bundle generation for repo-local MCP affordances `P1` `M`
- **Acceptance:** provider-native skill surfaces exist for both Claude Code and Codex

### 3.5.5 — Codex-primary command/control parity `[NEW]`
- [x] 3.5.5.1 — Make Codex the default provider for session launch/resume, teams, RC, workflow launches, and fleet worker execution `P0` `M`
- [x] 3.5.5.2 — Move self-improvement and sweep defaults to Codex-first planner/worker profiles `P0` `M`
- [x] 3.5.5.3 — Update failover and cascade defaults so Codex is the primary control-plane lane and Claude is the expensive reasoning specialist `P1` `M`
- [x] 3.5.5.4 — Pin Codex developer docs and local CLI capability notes in-repo for future sessions `P1` `S`
- [x] 3.5.5.5 — Add Codex plugin/subagent export flows alongside AGENTS.md skill export `P1` `M`

- [x] 3.5.5.8 — Add targeted regression tests proving omitted-provider prompt improvement paths prefer OpenAI/Codex semantics over Claude-specific scoring/tone rules `P1` `S`
- **Implementation notes (2026-04-04):**
  - Codex-primary parity is complete for the currently shipped control-plane workflows: sessions, resume, RC, teams, fleet worker discovery, loops, sweeps, self-improve, prompt enhancement, skill/plugin export, and operator docs.
  - Remaining roadmap work beyond this section is general platform work, not a Codex parity blocker, unless a new shipped workflow regresses to Claude-first behavior.
  - The key ongoing risk is silent drift: future provider-default edits can reintroduce Claude-biased copy or omitted-provider behavior if code and docs are not updated together.
  - If a future session genuinely needs Claude Code to unblock a parity item, do not switch ad hoc. Write a focused Claude Code prompt, copy it to the paste buffer, record the reason in the roadmap/session notes, and keep the Codex-led branch as the source of truth.
- **Acceptance:** omitted-provider control paths default to Codex and repo docs match runtime behavior

## Phase 9: R&D Cycle Automation `[NEW]`

New phase addressing the critical pipeline gap between findings and actionable work. Derived from analysis of 15 R&D cycles (174+ findings, 9.8% resolution rate). Goal: close the Finding -> Roadmap -> Task -> Execute -> Verify loop.

> **Depends on:** Phase 0.8 (scratchpad tools, observation query)
>
> **Parallel workstreams:** Tier 1 tools are critical path. Tier 2 depends on Tier 1 foundations. Tier 3 is independent.

## Phase 10: Claude Code Native Integration `[NEW]`

> **Research:** See [docs/claude-code-autonomy-research.md](docs/claude-code-autonomy-research.md) for full background.
>
> **Depends on:** Phase 9.5 (supervisor), Phase 2.75 (event bus)

### 10.1 — Sprint Executor Agent & Batch Integration
- [x] 10.1.1 — Create `.claude/agents/sprint-executor.md` with `isolation: worktree`, `permissionMode: dontAsk`, `model: sonnet` `P1` `S`
- [x] 10.1.2 — Create `.claude/agents/marathon-monitor.md` with `model: haiku` for cheap status polling `P2` `S`
- [ ] 10.1.3 — Integrate `/batch` decomposition for parallel sprint execution (5 ROADMAP items → 5 batch units) `P1` `M`
- [ ] 10.1.4 — Add batch result merging to `cycle_merge.go` for worktree outputs `P1` `M`
- **Acceptance:** `/batch "Implement next 5 ROADMAP items"` produces 5 parallel agents that each implement 1 item

### 10.2 — Cloud Scheduled Tasks & Durable Marathons
- [ ] 10.2.1 — Add cloud scheduled task support for durable marathon execution (replaces `marathon.sh`) `P1` `M`
- [ ] 10.2.2 — Implement session continuation via `--resume` for multi-sprint chains `P1` `M`
- [x] 10.2.3 — Add `supervisor_state.json` restoration for cross-invocation continuity `P1` `S`
- **Acceptance:** Cloud scheduled marathon runs unattended, resumes state across invocations

### 10.3 — Hook-Based Automation
- [x] 10.3.1 — Add PostToolUse hooks for auto-`go vet` / auto-lint on Write/Edit `P2` `S`
- [x] 10.3.2 — Add PreToolUse hooks for Bash safety rules (block `rm -rf`, force push) `P2` `S`
- [x] 10.3.3 — Add Stop hook to force continuation during marathon sessions `P2` `S`
- **Acceptance:** Hooks fire on tool use, enforcing code quality and safety gates automatically

### 10.4 — Permission & Context Management
- [ ] 10.4.1 — Integrate Auto Mode permission level for L2 marathon sessions `P1` `S`
- [ ] 10.4.2 — Add Compact Instructions to CLAUDE.md for marathon context preservation `P1` `S`
- [x] 10.4.3 — Wire `CompactionEnabled` in loop profile to trigger `/compact` between sprints `P1` `M`
- **Acceptance:** Marathon sessions use Auto Mode, compact cleanly between sprints preserving critical state

### 10.5 — Cost Optimization
- [ ] 10.5.1 — Integrate token counting API for accurate pre-cycle budget forecasting `P2` `S`
- [ ] 10.5.2 — Add Batch API support for non-interactive marathon workloads (50% discount) `P2` `M`

- [x] 10.5.3.3 — Detect resumed-Claude cache anomalies when cache writes occur without cache reads `P0` `S`
- [x] 10.5.3.4 — Surface cache-read/cache-write ratios in fleet analytics and session status `P1` `M`
- [x] 10.5.3.5 — Add automatic reroute from Claude to Codex when repeated Claude cache anomalies are detected in long-running orchestration `P1` `M`
- **Implementation notes (2026-04-04):**
  - Claude resumed-session cache safety is now treated as suspect by default in orchestration paths unless live cache reads are actually observed.
  - Session status and fleet analytics expose cache-read/cache-write health so reroute decisions are inspectable rather than implicit.
  - Follow-on work should prefer observable cache-health metrics over theoretical savings, and any Claude-specific optimization should preserve a clean reroute path back to Codex.
- **Acceptance:** Marathon cost per sprint reduced 50-80% vs naive execution

## R&D Cycle Architecture `[NEW]`

The self-improvement pipeline operates as a closed loop:

```
 Observations --> Journal --> Patterns --> Scratchpad --> Roadmap --> Curriculum
      ^                                                                  |
      |                                                                  v
      +--- Verify <--- Execute <--- Plan <--- finding_to_task <--- Prioritize
```

### Data flow per cycle

1. **Baseline** (`cycle_baseline`): Snapshot coverage, lint, build time, test count
2. **Plan** (`cycle_plan`): Read observations, identify regressions, generate task list
3. **Execute** (`loop_start`): Run tasks via StepLoop with cascade routing
4. **Observe** (`observation_query`): Record iteration outcomes, costs, diffs
5. **Learn** (`scratchpad_reason`): Analyze observations, extract findings
6. **Verify** (`merge_verify`, `loop_gates`): Confirm improvements, detect regressions
7. **Persist** (`scratchpad_append`): Write findings, update patterns
8. **Merge** (`cycle_merge`): Combine parallel worktree results

## Phase 10.5: Horizontal & Vertical Scaling `[NEW]`

Derived from 10-agent codebase analysis + 12-agent scaling research (2026-03-30). Each item maps to a specific bottleneck identified in the current codebase.

### 10.5.1 Session Manager Lock Splitting `P0` `L`

**Bottleneck:** Single `Manager.mu` RWMutex in `internal/session/manager.go` serializes all session operations at 100+ concurrent sessions.

- [x] Split into per-map fine-grained locks: `sessionsMu`, `workersMu`, `budgetMu`, `configMu`
- [ ] Use `sync.Map` for hot-path reads (session lookups, status queries)
- [ ] Add lock contention metrics (pprof mutex profile integration)
- [ ] Benchmark: target 70-80% contention reduction at 100 concurrent sessions
- Files: `internal/session/manager.go`, `internal/session/types.go`

### 10.5.2 MCP Server Concurrent Handler Limits `P1` `M`

**Bottleneck:** Large MCP tool surface with no concurrency limit on handlers means unbounded goroutine creation under load.

- [x] Add `semaphore.Weighted` (golang.org/x/sync) to `internal/mcpserver/middleware.go`
- [x] Default limit: 32 concurrent handlers, configurable via `MCP_MAX_CONCURRENT`
- [ ] Per-namespace rate limiting for expensive tools (fleet, session launch)
- [ ] Add handler queue depth metric
- Files: `internal/mcpserver/middleware.go`, `internal/mcpserver/server.go`

### 10.5.3 Event Bus Scaling (NATS Streaming) `P1` `L`

**Bottleneck:** In-process `events.Bus` with 1000-event ring buffer + JSONL persistence caps at single-node, single-process.

- [x] Abstract event bus behind `EventTransport` interface (in-memory default, NATS optional)
- [ ] NATS JetStream integration: persistent subjects per event type, consumer groups
- [ ] Windowed aggregation: 1m/5m/15m sliding windows for fleet metrics
- [ ] Partitioned storage: shard events by repo or session ID
- [ ] Event-driven TUI updates (replace 2s polling tick with bus subscription)
- Files: `internal/events/bus.go`, new `internal/events/nats.go`, `internal/tui/app.go`

### 10.5.4 Worker Pool Auto-Scaling `P1` `L`

**Bottleneck:** `MaxConcurrentWorkers=8` is static. No scaling based on queue depth, provider availability, or budget.

- [x] Auto-scale triggers: queue depth > 2x workers, provider rate limit headroom, budget remaining
- [ ] Provider specialization: route GPU-heavy tasks to specific workers, cost-optimize by provider
- [x] Health scoring: per-worker success rate, latency p99, stale task ratio
- [x] Priority queue with aging: prevent task starvation, priority decay over time
- [ ] Batch assignment: group related tasks (same repo, same provider) for worker affinity
- Files: `internal/fleet/coordinator.go`, `internal/fleet/worker.go`, new `internal/fleet/autoscaler.go`

### 10.5.5 Adaptive Iteration Depth `P1` `M`

**Bottleneck:** Fixed iteration limits waste compute on easy tasks and starve complex ones.

- [x] Complexity estimator: LOC, dependency depth, test count → predicted iterations
- [ ] Dynamic budget allocation: start conservative, expand on progress signals
- [ ] Deep work mode: for high-value tasks, double iteration limit + add verification passes
- [x] Smart convergence: detect diminishing returns (δ < threshold for N iterations → early stop)
- Files: `internal/session/loop.go`, `internal/session/convergence.go`, new `internal/session/depth.go`

### 10.5.6 Multi-Node Marathon Distribution `P1` `XL`

**Bottleneck:** Marathons run on a single machine. Large fleets need cross-node coordination.

- [ ] Repo sharding: partition repos across nodes by hash or explicit assignment
- [ ] Pipeline parallelism: plan on coordinator, execute on workers, verify on coordinator
- [ ] Warm-start prefetching: pre-clone repos + pre-pull models on target workers
- [ ] State replication: supervisor state sync across coordinator nodes (leader election)
- Files: `internal/fleet/coordinator.go`, `internal/session/manager_cycle.go`, new `internal/fleet/sharding.go`

### 10.5.7 Cost Optimization Engine `P1` `L`

**Bottleneck:** Static cascade routing misses 2-4x cost reduction opportunities.

- [x] Dynamic cost-tier routing via contextual bandits (extend existing UCB1 in `internal/bandit/`)
- [ ] Batch API utilization: auto-batch non-urgent tasks for 50% discount (extend `internal/batch/`)
- [ ] Fleet-wide prompt caching: shared cache prefix across sessions targeting same repo
- [ ] Budget forecasting: predict remaining marathon budget from spend velocity + task queue
- [ ] Token optimization: context pruning, tool call deduplication (target 25-35% reduction)
- Files: `internal/session/cascade.go`, `internal/batch/batch.go`, `internal/bandit/selector.go`

### 10.5.8 Git Scaling `P2` `L`

**Bottleneck:** Worktree creation overhead at scale, disk usage with many clones.

- [x] Worktree pooling: pre-create N worktrees per repo, reuse across sessions (10x creation speedup)
- [ ] Git alternates: share object store across clones (16x disk reduction for large repos)
- [ ] Merge conflict prevention: pre-check branch divergence before parallel work
- [ ] Multi-repo coordination: atomic cross-repo changes with two-phase commit
- Files: `internal/session/worktree.go`, new `internal/session/worktree_pool.go`

### 10.5.9 State Persistence (SQLite WAL) `P1` `L`

**Bottleneck:** JSON file persistence is fragile under concurrent access and doesn't scale.

- [x] SQLite WAL mode for fleet state (coordinator, sessions, observations)
- [x] Per-entity locking instead of global mutex
- [x] Session-store lock contention hardening: DSN `busy_timeout`, single-connection writes, and `SQLITE_BUSY` retries for migrate/save/update paths
- [ ] State sharding by repo for parallel writes
- [ ] Observation partitioning: time-based partitions for efficient queries
- [ ] Migration path from JSON files to SQLite (dual-write during transition)
- [ ] PostgreSQL control-plane research spike: evaluate an optional PostgreSQL backend for multi-node coordinator state when fleet deployment spans multiple hosts or network filesystems `P2` `M`
- [ ] Backend split study: map which entities remain local SQLite (`observations`, replay logs, checkpoints) versus shared control-plane state (`tenants`, sessions, loop_runs, cost_ledger, recovery_ops, fleet queue/leases) `P2` `S`
- [ ] Adapter and cutover design: confirm whether `internal/session/store.go` is sufficient for an optional PostgreSQL adapter, define config gate + bootstrap path, and document rollback/no-big-bang migration strategy `P2` `S`
- [ ] Coordination primitive evaluation: compare PostgreSQL advisory locks + LISTEN/NOTIFY against current file-lock and polling patterns, and record benchmark + ops criteria `P2` `S`
- **Acceptance:** source-backed memo recommends one of: keep SQLite-only, add optional PostgreSQL backend, or use per-node SQLite plus replication; includes schema candidates, migration sketch, lock/signaling approach, operational cost, and benchmark targets.
- Deps: `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go)
- Files: new `internal/store/sqlite.go`, `internal/fleet/coordinator.go`

### 10.5.10 Monitoring & Observability Stack `P2` `L`

**Bottleneck:** No external metrics export, no structured alerting.

- [x] Prometheus metrics exporter: session counts, costs, latencies, error rates
- [ ] Structured alerting: webhook, Slack, Discord notifications on fleet events
- [ ] Distributed tracing: OpenTelemetry spans for session lifecycle
- [ ] Capacity planning: predict resource needs from historical fleet data
- Files: new `internal/metrics/prometheus.go`, new `internal/metrics/alerting.go`

### 10.5.11 Autonomy Scaling `P2` `XL`

**Bottleneck:** Single-repo supervisor, no multi-repo autonomy.

- [ ] Multi-repo supervisor: coordinate R&D cycles across the hairglasses-studio org
- [ ] Contextual multi-armed bandit for task selection (per-repo arms with shared context)
- [ ] Online learning with concept drift detection (detect when past learnings become stale)
- [ ] Fleet-wide anomaly detector with kill switch (halt autonomy on regression)
- Files: `internal/session/manager_cycle.go`, `internal/session/autooptimize.go`, `internal/bandit/selector.go`

## Phase 11: A2A Protocol Integration `[NEW]`

Agent-to-Agent (A2A) v1.0.0 protocol integration for cross-node fleet coordination. A2A complements MCP — MCP handles model-to-tool communication, A2A handles agent-to-agent task delegation, status tracking, and artifact exchange.

**Go SDK:** `github.com/a2aproject/a2a-go/v2` (Go 1.24+, Apache 2.0)

### Current State

Partial A2A support exists in `internal/fleet/`:
- `a2a.go` — `A2AAdapter` with task offer lifecycle
- `a2a_card.go` — `AgentCard`, `BuildAgentCard()`, `DiscoverAgent()`, `RemoteA2AAdapter`
- Handlers at `/.well-known/agent.json` and `/api/v1/a2a/task/{taskID}`

### Gap Analysis

| Task lifecycle | `TaskOffer` string status | `Task` with typed `TaskState`, Messages, Artifacts | Adopt `a2a.Task` type |
| Message format | Plain `Prompt` string | Multi-part (Text/File/Data) | Need Part support |
| Streaming | Custom SSE | SSE on `/tasks/sendStreaming`, `/tasks/{id}/subscribe` | A2A-compliant endpoints |
| Push notifications | Not implemented | Webhook registration with auth | New feature |
| Authentication | None (network trust) | SecuritySchemes (apiKey, bearer, OAuth2, mTLS) | Need scheme enforcement |

- [ ] Workers advertise skills via Agent Card (provider type, model, capacity)
- [ ] Coordinator indexes capabilities from discovered cards
- [ ] Route tasks based on discovered skills, not hardcoded provider configs
- [ ] Supervisor health checks via A2A task status subscriptions
- Files: `internal/fleet/discovery.go`, `internal/fleet/types.go`

### 11.5 Event Bus Federation `P2` `L`

### Current State

Partial Tailscale support exists:
- `internal/fleet/types.go` — `WorkerInfo.TailscaleIP` field
- `internal/fleet/discovery.go` — `GetTailscaleStatus()` (shells out to `tailscale status --json`), `DiscoverCoordinator()` probes peers
- `internal/fleet/worker.go` — `RegisterPayload.TailscaleIP`, `DiscoverTailscaleIP()` stub
- `cmd/serve.go` — Auto-discovers coordinator via Tailscale peer probing

### Tag Taxonomy

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `tag:ralph-fleet` | All ralphglasses nodes |
| `tag:ralph-coordinator` | Fleet coordinator (thin client) |

- [ ] **FL-3** — Cross-silo topology map: classify Tailscale peers as silo (synchronous FedAvg) or device (async SGD with stale tolerance) — acceptance: device dropout doesn't block silo rounds; `fleet_topology` MCP tool returns classification
- [ ] **FL-4** — Secure aggregation via Shamir (k,n) threshold secret sharing: coordinator learns only summed vector — acceptance: reconstruction fails with < k shares; fallback to DP when nodes < k+1
- Files: `internal/fedlearn/aggregator.go`, `internal/fedlearn/dp.go`, `internal/fedlearn/topology.go`, `internal/fedlearn/secure_agg.go`

### 25.2 Federated Specialization `P2` `L`
- [ ] **FL-5** — LoRA-rank federated fine-tuning bridge for enhancer: SVD-decomposed adapter deltas, FlexLoRA-style redistribution — acceptance: scoring accuracy improves ≥5% after 5 rounds; adapter delta < 500KB/round
- [ ] **FL-6** — Personalized FL for per-node provider preference (FedPer split-model): global shared trunk + private personalization head — acceptance: per-node selection accuracy ≥85% within 10 iterations; head survives restart
- [ ] **FL-7** — Federated soft-prompt tuning for shared planning instructions: ≤64 token soft-prompt prefix trained collectively — acceptance: planner completion rate increases ≥10% after 10 rounds
- [ ] **FL-8** — Data-free federated distillation (FEDGEN-style): synthetic episodes for regularizing local training — acceptance: ≥15% faster curriculum convergence; generator cost < $0.10/round
- [ ] **FL-9** — Federated bandit for fleet-wide provider routing: privatized (DP-noised, ε=4) count/reward summaries to coordinator — acceptance: fleet-wide win rate converges within 5% of oracle after 20 rounds across 3 nodes

## Whiteclaw-Derived Overhaul (2026-04-08)

This tranche applies the highest-value whiteclaw findings that fit this repo's real surface: engineer briefs, bounded skills/runbooks, searchable provenance, scoped MCP packaging, and explicit verification ladders.

### Strategic Focus
- Use whiteclaw patterns to harden the repo's operator front door: engineer briefs, discovery surfaces, and explicit verification ladders.
- Prefer typed contracts and reusable control-plane machinery over more handwritten transport or prompt glue.
- Keep the repo searchable and self-describing so future sweeps do not depend on raw code spelunking.

### Recommended Work
- [ ] [Structure] Document subtree ownership and canonical source boundaries across nested modules, packages, or roadmaps.
- [ ] [CI] Add at least one smoke workflow that proves the public build/test path still matches the docs.
- [ ] [Verification] Add a layered verification ladder: build/lint, help/startup, discovery/health, and one non-destructive end-to-end check.
- [ ] [Telemetry] Tighten `.ralph` verification, cost, recovery, and improvement-journal coverage around the flows that actually matter.
- [ ] [Discovery] Add or harden a discovery-first contract layer for catalog/search/schema/health before widening the mutating tool surface.
- [ ] [Public docs] Keep release, migration, and example docs aligned with the real public workflow.

### Rationale Snapshot
- Tier / lifecycle: `tier-1` / `active`
- Language profile: `Go`
- Visibility / sensitivity: `PUBLIC` / `public`
- Surface baseline: AGENTS=yes, skills=yes, codex=yes, mcp_manifest=configured, ralph=yes, roadmap=yes
- Whiteclaw transfers in scope: verification ladder, skill/runbook splits, manifest smoke tests, engineer brief
- Live repo notes: AGENTS, skills, Codex config, configured .mcp.json, .ralph, multi-module/workspace, nested roadmaps
